        <h1>History of cats</h1>
        <p>In ancient Egypt, cats were loved for their ability to protect homes from pests and dangerous animals like snakes and scorpions. They also held deep religious significance, particularly through the goddess Bastet. Egyptians mummified cats and dedicated them to the goddess, even placing them in tombs to accompany their owners into the afterlife. This reverence was so strong that killing a cat, even accidentally, could result in severe punishment, and cats were cherished companions, sometimes adorned with jewelry.  </p>
